## Learning Approach

**Project-Based Learning**: Each case study involves real business scenarios with datasets, requiring practical SQL solutions for data analysis, reporting, and insights generation.

**Incremental Complexity**: Starting with basic SELECT statements and progressively tackling advanced topics like window functions, CTEs, and query optimization.

**Documentation Focus**: Every solution includes clear explanations, thought process, and lessons learned to reinforce understanding and create a valuable reference.
