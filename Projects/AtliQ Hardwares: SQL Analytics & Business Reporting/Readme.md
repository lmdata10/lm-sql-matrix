A comprehensive SQL analytics project exploring finance, customer performance, and supply chain optimization in the hardware industry.

## Overview

This is an end-to-end data analytics project that demonstrates advanced SQL capabilities by extracting actionable insights from hardware industry data. The project analyzes over 1.5 million records across multiple fact and dimension tables, uncovering trends in financial performance, customer behavior, and supply chain efficiency.

**Project Goals:**

- Analyze financial metrics (P&L, gross sales, net sales)
- Identify top-performing markets, customers, and products
- Evaluate supply chain forecast accuracy
- Optimize query performance for large datasets

## üíº Business Problem

AtliQ Hardware needs to:

1. **Track financial performance** across markets and product lines
2. **Identify revenue drivers** among customers and products
3. **Improve forecast accuracy** to optimize inventory and reduce costs
4. **Make data-driven decisions** for strategic planning

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Monthly and yearly revenue tracking
- P&L statement generation
- Gross price and net sales calculations
- Customer-level profitability analysis

### Top Performers Analysis

- Top N markets by net sales
- Customer segmentation by revenue contribution
- Product performance by division
- Regional market analysis

### Supply Chain Analysis

- Forecast accuracy measurement
- Year-over-year accuracy comparison
- Absolute and net error analysis
- Automated data synchronization with triggers

### Performance Optimization

- Query execution time reduced by 50%
- Efficient use of generated columns
- Strategic indexing and view creation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Languages**: SQL

## üîç Key Analyses

### 1. Finance Analysis

**Objectives:**

- Generate monthly product sales reports
- Track gross sales aggregates
- Create yearly revenue summaries
- Assign market performance badges

**Key Queries:**

```sql
-- Monthly sales for specific customer (FY 2021)
SELECT 
    s.date,
    p.product,
    s.sold_quantity,
    ROUND(g.gross_price * s.sold_quantity, 2) AS gross_price_total
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_code = p.product_code
JOIN fact_gross_price g ON g.product_code = s.product_code
WHERE s.customer_code = 90002002 
    AND get_fiscal_year(s.date) = 2021;
```

### 2. Top Performers Analysis

**Objectives:**

- Identify top markets by net sales
- Rank customers by revenue contribution
- Analyze product performance by division
- Compare regional performance

**Performance Optimization:**

- Added generated `fiscal_year` column to reduce function calls
- Created layered views for complex calculations
- Achieved 50% query execution time reduction

### 3. Supply Chain Analysis

**Objectives:**

- Measure forecast accuracy across customers
- Calculate net and absolute errors
- Compare year-over-year performance
- Automate data integration with triggers

**Key Metrics:**

- Forecast Accuracy = 100% - Absolute Error %
- Net Error = Forecast - Actual
- Absolute Error = |Forecast - Actual|

## üìä Results & Insights
